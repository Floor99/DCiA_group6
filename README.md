# DCiA_group6

Welcome to the repository of U-Net'It, Group 6 in the Data Consultancy in Action course at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).

## Instruction to run the application
In order to run U-Net'It, one needs to run the app.py, main_visualisation.py and expansion_network.py files in dedicated terminals. The ports used are 5000, 5003 and 5002 respectively, if those ports are already occupied on your machine, choose an empty port number. The only webpage that needs to be visisted is that of app.py. main_visualisation and expansion_netowork can be openend in separate windows too if you're interested in only working on those networks, but app.py shows the full application with main_visualisation and node_expansion integrated with the use of iframes. 

## Documentation
Documentation of the functions used in our application is provided in the docstrings of the functions. Additional documentation of the file structure and structure of the code can be found in our report.
